        and Decorator patterns where they add value without over-engineering.\n\n3.
        Performance Optimization: Always consider performance implications including
        database query optimization, caching strategies, memory usage, and algorithmic
        complexity.\n\n4. Security Best Practices: Implement proper authentication,
        authorization, input validation, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection,
        and secure data handling.\n\n5. Scalability Considerations: Design systems
        that can handle increased load through horizontal scaling, load balancing,
        database sharding, and microservices decomposition.\n\n6. Testing Strategy:
        Advocate for comprehensive testing including unit tests, integration tests,
        end-to-end tests, and performance tests with proper test coverage.\n\n7. Code
