        is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language designed for programmer
        productivity and happiness, created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (often called Matz)
        in 1995. Here''s a comprehensive overview:\n\nCore Language Characteristics:\n-
        Dynamically typed, interpreted language\n- Pure object-oriented: everything
        is an object\n- Supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented,
        functional, imperative)\n- Designed with the principle of \"developer happiness\"
        and programmer productivity\n- Supports metaprogramming and dynamic method
        definition\n- Garbage-collected language with automatic memory management\n\nKey
        Language Features:\n1. Object-Oriented Design\n```ruby\nclass Person\n  attr_accessor
        :name, :age\n\n  def initialize(name, age)\n    @name = name\n    @age = age\n  end\n\n  def
        introduce\n    \"Hi, I''m #{@name}, #{@age} years old\"\n  end\nend\n\nperson
        = Person.new(\"Alice\", 30)\nputs person.introduce\n```\n\n2. Metaprogramming
        Capabilities\n```ruby\nclass Object\n  def log_method_call(method_name)\n    original_method
        = instance_method(method_name)\n    define_method(method_name) do |*args,
        &block|\n      puts \"Calling method: #{method_name}\"\n      original_method.bind(self).call(*args,
        &block)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nclass Calculator\n  def add(a, b)\n    a +
        b\n  end\n  log_method_call :add\nend\n```\n\n3. Blocks and Functional Programming\n```ruby\n#
        Functional-style iteration\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map { |n| n * 2 }\n# => [2, 4,
        6, 8, 10]\n\n# Custom method with block\ndef with_logging\n  puts \"Starting
        operation\"\n  result = yield\n  puts \"Operation completed\"\n  result\nend\n\nwith_logging
        { 42 }\n```\n\nEcosystem and Frameworks:\n1. Ruby on Rails\n- Most popular
