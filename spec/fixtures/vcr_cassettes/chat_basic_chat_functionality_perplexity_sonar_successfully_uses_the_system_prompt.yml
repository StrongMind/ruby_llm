        "content": "**Weather** is the state of the atmosphere at a given time and
        place, describing conditions such as temperature (hot or cold), moisture (wet
        or dry), wind (calm or stormy), and cloudiness (clear or cloudy)[1]. It is
        a dynamic process that shapes the Earth\u2019s surface through phenomena like
        erosion and precipitation, which can be slightly acidic due to dissolved carbon
        dioxide[1].\n\nWeather varies by region and is influenced by factors such
        as latitude and the Earth''s rotation. For example, tropical weather tends
        to be warmer and more spontaneous in terms of cloud and rainstorm formation
        compared to higher latitudes, where atmospheric forces are more stable and
        predictable[1].\n\nFor current and forecasted weather conditions, many rely
        on services like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
        which provides detailed weather, hydrologic, and climate forecasts and warnings
        in the United States[3]. Commercial apps such as The Weather Channel and AccuWeather
        offer live radar, storm tracking, allergy alerts, and hourly to daily forecasts
        to help plan activities and stay safe during severe weather events[2][4].\n\nIf
        you want specific weather information for your location or upcoming days,
        using these services or apps will provide the most accurate and up-to-date
        data.\n\nXKCD7392"}, "delta": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}]}'
