        in France and serves as the political, cultural, commercial, and administrative
        center of the country. It is located on the Seine River in the north-central
        part of France and is the core of the \u00cele-de-France region. As of 2025,
        Paris has an estimated population of about 2 million people within its administrative
        limits and over 12 million in the wider metropolitan area[1][2][4].\n\nHistorically,
        Paris became the capital of France in 508 under King Clovis and has maintained
        this status almost continuously since, except during the German occupation
        in World War II when the capital was temporarily moved to Vichy[1].\n\nParis
        is renowned worldwide for its significant cultural landmarks, such as the
        Louvre Museum, Notre Dame Cathedral, and the Eiffel Tower, as well as its
        influence in fashion, finance, diplomacy, and gastronomy. It is also famously
        known as the \"City of Light\" and the \"City of Love\"[2][3]."}, "delta":
