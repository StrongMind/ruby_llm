        a more detailed overview of Ruby:\n\nLanguage Design:\n- Created by Yukihiro
        Matsumoto in 1995\n- Philosophy: \"Principle of least surprise\"\n- Designed
        to make programming more enjoyable and productive\n- Fully object-oriented
        language (everything is an object)\n\nKey Technical Features:\n- Dynamic typing\n-
        Automatic memory management\n- Supports multiple programming paradigms\n-
        Interpreted language\n- Uses garbage collection\n- Strong metaprogramming
        capabilities\n\nSyntax Characteristics:\n- Clean, readable, and concise\n-
        Uses indentation for readability\n- Supports functional programming concepts\n-
        Uses snake_case for method and variable names\n- Uses CamelCase for class
        and module names\n\nPopular Use Cases:\n- Web development (Ruby on Rails framework)\n-
        Scripting\n- Automation\n- DevOps tools\n- Prototyping\n- Backend web services\n\nEcosystem:\n-
        RubyGems package manager\n- Large open-source community\n- Extensive library
        of pre-built modules\n- Strong testing frameworks\n\nPerformance:\n- Generally
        slower than compiled languages\n- Improved performance with JIT compilation
        in recent versions\n- Good for rapid development and scripting\n\nMajor Companies
        Using Ruby:\n- GitHub\n- Airbnb\n- Shopify\n- Twitch\n- SoundCloud\n\nWould
        you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects of Ruby?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":215,"cache_read_input_tokens":2745,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":215,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":315,"service_tier":"standard"}}'
