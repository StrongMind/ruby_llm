        the user is asking about Ruby''s creator. Let me start by recalling what I
        know about Ruby. Ruby is a programming language, right? I remember that it
        was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto. Wait, his name is sometimes spelled as
        Matz. Let me confirm that. Yes, Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto is the creator.
        He started working on Ruby in the mid-1990s. The first version was released
        in 1995, and he continued developing it, leading to the 1.0 release in 1997.
        \n\nI should mention that Matsumoto designed Ruby with a focus on simplicity
        and productivity. The language is known for its elegant syntax and readability.
        He also contributed to the Ruby on Rails framework, which became very popular.
        \n\nWait, should I clarify that Matsumoto is the main creator, and maybe mention
        other contributors? Or is he the sole creator? I think he is the primary one,
        but there might be others who contributed to the development. However, the
        main credit goes to him. \n\nAlso, maybe the user is confused between Ruby
        and Ruby on Rails. But the question specifically asks about Ruby''s creator,
        so I should stick to that. \n\nLet me structure the answer: start by stating
        Matsumoto is the creator, mention his nickname Matz, the timeframe of creation,
        and maybe a bit about his philosophy. Also, note that he continues to be involved
        in the Ruby community. \n\nI should check if there''s any confusion with other
        languages or if there''s any other person associated with Ruby''s creation.
        I don''t think so. Ruby is a single creator language in that sense. \n\nSo
        the answer would be Yukihiro Matsumoto, also known as Matz, who created Ruby
        in the mid-90s. Make sure to mention that he''s still active in the community.
        That should cover it.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\nRuby was created by **Yukihiro

        the user asked, \"What year did he create Ruby?\" Let me check the previous
        conversation. In the first response, I mentioned that Ruby was created by
        Matz in the mid-1990s, with the first version released in 1995. The user is
        now specifically asking for the year.\n\nI need to confirm the exact year.
        From what I remember, Matz started working on Ruby in 1993, but the first
        public release was in 1995. So the answer should be 1995. The user might be
        looking for the release year rather than the start of development. I should
        make sure to state that the first version was released in 1995. Also, maybe
        mention that development started earlier but the official release was in 1995.
