        a more detailed overview of Ruby:\n\nLanguage Design and Philosophy:\n- Created
        by Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1995\n- Designed with the principle of \"developer
        happiness\"\n- Follows the principle of \"least surprise\" - code should behave
        intuitively\n- Emphasizes human-readable code and programmer productivity\n\nKey
        Technical Features:\n- Fully object-oriented: everything is an object\n- Dynamic
        typing\n- Automatic memory management (garbage collection)\n- Support for
        functional programming paradigms\n- Built-in support for metaprogramming\n-
        Supports multiple inheritance through modules\n\nPopular Use Cases:\n1. Web
        Development\n- Ruby on Rails framework is extremely popular\n- Used by companies
        like Airbnb, GitHub, Shopify\n\n2. Scripting and Automation\n- Great for writing
        quick scripts\n- Used in system administration\n- Supports cross-platform
        scripting\n\n3. DevOps and Infrastructure\n- Used in configuration management\n-
        Tools like Chef and Puppet are written in Ruby\n\nSyntax Characteristics:\n-
        Clean and expressive syntax\n- Uses snake_case for method and variable names\n-
        Optional parentheses in method calls\n- Blocks and lambdas are first-class
        citizens\n\nCommunity and Ecosystem:\n- Strong, supportive open-source community\n-
        RubyGems package manager\n- Regular language updates\n- Annual RubyConf and
        regional conferences\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":203,"cache_read_input_tokens":2745,"output_tokens":327}}'
