        method #{name} called\"\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nDynamicExample.create_method(:hello)\nDynamicExample.new.hello  #
        Outputs: Dynamic method hello called\n```\n\n2. Functional Programming Support\n```ruby\n#
        Higher-order functions and blocks\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquared = numbers.map
        { |n| n ** 2 }\nsum = numbers.reduce(:+)\n```\n\n3. Exception Handling\n```ruby\nbegin\n  #
        Risky operation\n  result = dangerous_method()\nrescue StandardError => e\n  #
        Custom error handling\n  log_error(e)\n  handle_gracefully(e)\nensure\n  #
